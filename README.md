# Finetuning-LLama2

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLama2 model for specific tasks. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to better fit the requirements of your particular application, improving performance and accuracy.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start fine-tuning the LLama2 model. Follow the steps below:

1. Load the pre-trained LLama2 model.
2. Prepare your dataset for fine-tuning.
3. Configure the training parameters.
4. Start the fine-tuning process.

Here is an example of how to fine-tune the model:

```python
from llama2 import LLama2Model

# Load pre-trained model
model = LLama2Model.from_pretrained('llama2-base')

# Prepare dataset
dataset = load_dataset('your_dataset')

# Configure training parameters
training_args = {
    'epochs': 3,
    'batch_size': 16,
    'learning_rate': 2e-5
}

# Start fine-tuning
model.fine_tune(dataset, training_args)
```

## Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the fine-tuned LLama2 model:

### Text Classification
Fine-tune the model for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or spam detection.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Adapt the model to recognize named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.

### Question Answering
Use the fine-tuned model to build a question-answering system that can provide accurate answers to user queries.
