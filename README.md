# Finetuning-LLama2

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLama2 model for specific tasks. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to better fit the requirements of your particular application, improving performance and accuracy. Follow the steps below:

1. Load the pre-trained LLama2 model.
2. Prepare your dataset for fine-tuning.
3. Configure the training parameters.
4. Start the fine-tuning process.
